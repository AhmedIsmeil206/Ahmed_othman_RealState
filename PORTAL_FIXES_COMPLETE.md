- Fixed `location` to use lowercase values (`maadi`, `mokkattam`)

- Added proper error handling and success feedback
- Fixed API data format according to `/apartments/sale` endpoint documentation

### 2. ‚úÖ **Rental Studios & Sale Apartments Fetching Fixed**
**Problem:** Data was not fetching and rendering in master admin/admin dashboards
